    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles about cities in different US states. For this assignment, we will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of the articles about the cities."

We request summary 'page info' for multiple article pages. The API documentation, [API:Info](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Info), covers additional details that may be helpful when trying to use or understand this part.\n",

You might have a hard time finding this \"dashboard\". First, on the left hand side of the page, you'll see a column of links. The bottom section is a set of links titled \"Tools\". In that section is a link that says [Special pages](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages) which will take you to a list of ... well, special pages. At the very bottom of the \"Special pages\" page is a section titled \"Other special pages\" (scroll all the way to the bottom). The first link in that section is called [API keys](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:AppManagement). When you get to the \"API keys\" page you can create a new key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authentication guide suggests that you should create a server-side app key. This does not seem to work correctly - as yet. It failed on multiple attempts when I attempted to create a server-side app key. BUT, there is an option to create a Personal API token that should work for this course and the type of ORES page scoring that you will need to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, when you create a Personal API token you are granted the three items - a Client ID, a Client secret, and a Access token - you shold save all three of these. When you dismiss the box they are gone. If you lose any one of the tokens you can destroy or deactivate the Personal API token from the dashboard and then create a new one.\n",
